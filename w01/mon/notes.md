# Introductions

## Describe when you were first excited by computers or programming.

## What is your old/current job?

# Schedule and Expectations

- Work life balance is important. I'm here to help you as much as possible but:
  * Don't Slack message me after 8pm.
  * I might check Slack on weekends, but email is best
  * Emailing me at kurt@theironyard.com is generally the best after-hours option

- I need an hour of administrative time in the afternoon for interviews, lecture prep, etc.

- I do way more than just Ruby. As such, I will occasionally start to type something that doesn't exist in Ruby, have to look at the API docs, and correct myself.

- If you're unclear on anything, ask. This is my first time teaching complete beginners so especially during the first half of the course, stop me if I don't explain something.

# Preliminaries

- Remember that you are here to learn a way of thinking and problem solving, not a specific set of tools. I don't care what text editor, testing suite, or keyboard you use.

- Programming is all about trade offs. There are no perfect, finished programs.

- You will spend half of your working life reading code, not writing it.

> Thus, programs must be written for people to read,
> and only incidentally for machines to execute.

# Tools Discussion

- History and context is important. Certain things I just want you to know exist. I'll try to let
  you know what's nonessential / just for context. I'll do my best not to go off on tangents. :)

## Let's talk a bit about our four main tools: Shell, Editor, Programming Language, Version Control.

- Editor / Programming Language.

- Shell. Where did it come from? Why use it?

- Version Control. Where did it come from? Why use it?

# Package Management

## A Brief Aside

- There is usually system-level package management. That's homebrew.
- There is also language-level package management. That's bundler.

# A Shell Checkup

### Commands:

- pwd
- cd
- ls
- cp, mv, rm
- cat / less
- mkdir / rmdir
- clear
- ssh / sudo
- man
- grep

# A Shell Checkup

### Concepts:

- files vs directories
- absolute vs relative paths
- hidden files
- tilde / $HOME
- .. / -
- permissions (are a thing we'll get to)
- pipes
- redirection

# Start your rubies!

## Let's talk data types!

- Booleans
- Numbers
- Strings
- Symbols
- Arrays

# Variables and I/O

- Puts
- Gets
- Chomp

# Conditionals

### Basics: `if then else elsif end`
### One-legged: `when unless`

# Looping and Iteration

## Un-conditionally
- `for i in FOO`
- `times`
- `each`

## Conditionally
- `while`
- `until`

## Ranges!
- `upto`
- `downto`

# Methods

### def

### Substitution Model of Evaluation (with caveats)

### Expressions vs Statements

# A Brief Aside on Scoping

- Environments
- Bound vs Free variables

# A larger example ...

## Let's Fizzbuzz!

# `ruby` vs `irb`

## (a.k.a Running and Testing your Damn Code)

- ruby is for running an '.rb' file or script usually
- irb is for trying things out

- You can paste code into irb.
- You should always try out functions (or even just snippets)
  as you go to make sure things behave as you expect.
