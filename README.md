## Policies

In general, I'll be treating you like autonomous adults, which means
**you will have plenty of rope to hang yourself**. There are a few things I'll
make explicit though...

### Attendance

Attendance is expected every day class is in session, but not required. If you
miss more than **4** days, your job placement may be forfeit.

### Coursework

Please do the [pre-work](http://kurtisnelson.gitbooks.io/rails-prework/) before the first day.

Homework will be assigned daily and semi-regularly discussed in class the next
day. It is **your** responsibility to be sure you're keeping up with the
homework and seek out help (from a TA or me) if you're struggling.

The course will culminate in a large final project, likely in a group
with 1 or 2 Frontend developers. The last 3 weeks of class will
focus on building these projects, and lectures will be largely curtailed.

It's worth thinking about what you'd like to build now as this project
will likely be the anchor of your portfolio and an important part of
your hiring success after graduation.

## Topics

Here's a tree of Rails-related concepts (from

We probably won't cover every leaf, but we will at least visit each
branch. A timeline will be posted shortly that will give a better idea
of our path through the tree.
